#Image Classification Project - Competition Winner
This project was developed as part of a competition on Kaggle's AML 2024 Project 1, where it secured the top position.

#Project Overview
The main objective of this project was to compare the performance of different neural network architectures in the context of image classification. The project focused on:

#Benchmarking MLP vs. CNN: 
Initially, I benchmarked the performance of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Performance Comparison with EfficientNet: Subsequently, I compared the performance of my custom CNN model with the state-of-the-art EfficientNet architecture by Google.
